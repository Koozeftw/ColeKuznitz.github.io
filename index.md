<h1>Investigating the Relationship Between Cuisine and Recipe Rating</h1>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Cole Kuznitz</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Everyone on this planet must eat, but what each person eats varies. For many people, they will look online to find meals that entice them, often those that are rated the highest. When searching recipes in google, Food.com is the fifth link that comes up and upon going on Food.com and clicking on a recipe, the rating is at the top of the screen, making it easy to screen the good recipes from the bad recipes.</p>

<p>My goal was to find if the recipe's rating was dependent on the cuisine of the dish. To do this I am going to use two datasets, the Recipes and Interactions dataset which have both been scraped from Food.com. The Recipes dataset contains a column called 'id' which contains the id of the recipe, and the Interactions data contains a similar column called 'recipe_id.' Upon renaming 'id' to 'recipe_id' it was possible to left merge the Interactions dataset onto the Recipe dataset, resulting in a merged dataset with 234429 rows and 17 columns.</p>

<p>The most relevant columns in this dataset are: 'name', a column containing the name of the dish as a string, 'rating', a column containing a float value from 1 to 5 describing the rating in stars that a recipe received, 'nutrition', a column containing a string representation of the float values of calories in a dish and then total_fat, saturated_fat, protein, carbohydrates, sugar, and sodium in units of percent daily values (PDV), and 'contributor_id', a column containing an integer of the id of the person that added the recipe to Food.com.</p>

<h2 id="datacleaningandexploratoryanalysis">Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>Data cleaning began with replacing all of the 0 ratings in the 'rating' column with a NaN value. This is due to a 0 rating being outside of the rating scale of the site, so a 0 score is a missing rating. By changing these values to NaN values it allows for the exclusion of these recipes which have not received a valid rating in aggregation, as well as for consideration in further hypothesis testing.</p>

<p>Duplicates were then dropped, which ensures that each data point is unique and that certain categories can't be unfairly weighted due to having artificial weighting from the same thing being represented multiple times.</p>

<p>The column average rating was then added, which is the float value of the rating for each 'recipe_id'. The nutrition column was then split into different columns based on the data contained within, including calories, total_fat, sodium, sugar, saturated_fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Each of these new columns contains float values, and each column besides calories was updated to be in units of grams instead of PDV.</p>

<p>The next step was to create a column named 'tokenized' which contained a list of strings where each name was broken into tokens. Using this column it was then possible to sort each dish into a cuisine using a predefined dictionary.</p>

<p>This dictionary allowed for the creation of the 'cuisine' column, which contained the sorted cuisine for each dish stored as a string, and 'other' for any dish that didn't fall into any of those categories.</p>

<p>Unnecessary columns were dropped from the dataframe, including 'tokenized', 'nutrition', 'index', 'review', 'submitted', 'tags', 'n_steps', 'description', 'user_id', 'n_ingredients', 'minutes', 'steps', and 'date'. This left a total of 13 columns in the dataframe, with our final cleaned, merged dataframe looking like this:</p>

<p>If you take a look at the cuisine for 2000 meatloaf, you'd notice that it has been sorted into chinese. This is due to the 'lo' section in meatloaf matching the 'lo' in the chinese dictionary.  This was left like this to show the shortcomings of the sorting function.  This shortcoming was left in due to the fact that otherwise it would have to be changed to become exact matches, meaning that cheeseburgers, would have to be included with cheeseburger, which would drastically increase the size of the dictionary and decrease the efficiency of the matching function.</p>
<h3 id="univariateanalysis">Univariate Analysis</h3>
<p>This graph examines the disctribution of ratings given to each recipe in the dataset.  The graph shows a left skew with an overwhelming proportion of the recipes having a 5 star rating.  A 4 star rating has the second greatest proportion showing a clear bias towards higher ratings for the recipes on Food.com</p>

<p>This plot shows the average rating of each cuisine.  It shows a very consistent rating amongst the cuisines, with each having an average rating over 4.  The total range is only approximately 0.5 with the highest average cuisine being indonesian with an average rating of 4.85, and the lowest average rated cuisine being vietnamese which had an average rating of 4.375, giving a full spread of 0.475. This small range could imply no relationship between the rating and cuisine, but hypothesis testing will reveal if that is true.</p>

<h3 id="NMAR Analysis">NMAR Analysis</h3>
<p>I believe that the 'rating' column which had previously been updated to inlcude Nan values instead of 0's is NMAR.  This is due to the fact that leaving a review is completely optional.  This means that the recipe needs to have affected them in some strong manner to warrant the user taking the extra time out of their day to leave a rating. It would be expected then that the most common ratings are those on both ends of the spectrum, 1 and 5, however as seen before there is a distinct lack of 1 star ratings.  A possible explanation for the lack of 1 star ratings is that people are unwilling to do something they view as confrontational, in leaving a bad review.</p>

<h3 id="Missingness Dependency">Missingness Dependency</h3>
<p>
  To test the missingness of the 'rating' column a permutation test was performed to see if the missingness was dependent on 'contributor_id'.<br>
  There were a total of 1000 permutations run. The two hypothesis were:<br>
  H<sub>o</sub>: The missingness does not depend on 'contributor_id.'<br>
  H<sub>a</sub>: The missingness does depend on 'contributor_id.'<br>
  Test Statistic: The absolute difference in mean missingness rates between the two columns.<br>
  Significance Level: 0.05.

<p>This graph visualizes the 1000 generated differences.  The red line is the observed difference which was 3.333.  The calculated p-value of 0.0130 is less than the significance level of 0.05 which means that the null hypothesis would be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis that missingness does depoend on 'contributor_id.'</p>
<p>To determine that missingness is actually dependent on 'contributor_id' and not just dependent on any column, another permutation test was performed, this time with 'sugar' as the test column.<br>
The test hypothesis are: <br>
H<sub>0</sub> Missingness is not dependent on 'sugar' <br>
H<sub>a</sub> Missingness is dependnet on 'sugar'<br>
Test Statistic: The absolute difference in mean missingness rates between the two columns.<br>
Significance Level: 0.05 </p>

<p>This graph is a visualization of the 1000 generated differences.  The red line is the observed difference of 0.000 and the p-value found was 0.9310 which is far greater than the significance level of 0.05 that was set meaning that I fail to reject the null hypothesis.  The missingness is not dependent on the column 'sugar.'</p>

<h2 id="hypothesistesting">Hypothesis Testing</h2>
<p>I'm investigating if the cuisine of the recipe influences the rating of the recipe.  Before doing this investigation though, I first want to further look into the trend that was noticed in the Unvariate Analysis section where it seems that higher ratings are favored.  Overall, I performed two different hypothesis tests with the first being an investigation into detecting there presencee of a bias towards higher ratings. The null and alternate hypothesis were: <br>
H<sub>o</sub>: The average rating of dishes on the website is what we would expect if users rated dishes uniformly at random<br>
H<sub>a</sub>: The average rating of dishes on the website is higher than expected by chance <br>
Test Statistic: Difference between simulated and expected mean <br>
Significance Level: 0.5</p>

<p>This graph shows that every one of the simulated differences is around 1.5, which is much different than the expected difference of 0, which would have occured had the average rating on Food.com been the expected value of 3.  This instead suggest that average rating is around 1.5 points higher at around 4.5.  With a p-value of 0.0, which is less that the significance value of 0.05 I would reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis that the average rating of the dishes is higher than would be expected on chance, thus meaning that there is a bias towards giving recipes a higher rating.</p>
<p>The next investigation was into the effect of cuisine on the rating of the dish.  This was done under the null and alternate hypotheses:<br>
H<sub>o</sub>: The type of cuisine has no effect on rating of the recipe <br>
H<sub>a</sub>: The type of cuisine effects the rating of the recipe <br>
Test Statistic: Absolute difference in mean rating between recipes of the cuisine and the rest of the dishes<br>
Significance Level: 0.05</p>
