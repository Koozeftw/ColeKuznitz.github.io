# Investigating the Relationship Between Cuisine and Recipe Rating
Author: Cole Kuznitz  

## Introduction {#introduction}
Everyone on this planet must eat, but what each person eats varies.  For many people, they will look online to find meals that entice them, often those that are rated the highest. When searching recipes in google, Food.com is the fifth link that comes up and upon going on Food.com and clicking on a recipe, the rating is at the top of the screen, making it easy to screen the good recipes from the bad recipes.  My goal was to find if the recipe's rating was dependent on the cuisine of the dish.  To do this I am going to use two datasets, the Recipes and Interactions dataset which have both been scraped from Food.com. The Recipes dataset contains a column called 'id' which contains the id of the recipe, and the Interactions data contains a similar column called 'recipe_id.'  Upon renaming 'id' to 'recipe_id' it was possible to left merge the Interactions dataset onto the Recipe dataset, resulting in a merged dataset
